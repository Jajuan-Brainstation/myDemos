Live Demo component for CSS Flexbox lecture in WDFT Winter 2020

## Recommended method of delivery:
- Recap the box model and `display` types we've already covered (block, inline, inline-block)
- Talk about the need for a better way to do modern layouts without the need for hacks (nice to show an example, like brainstation.io)
- Then proceed through the slides, going back to the demo for each section (basics/display: flex container, flex-direction, justify-content, etc) one at a time

## Notes
- Bring up caniuse.com and remind them that the IE11 support is only partial
- Make sure they understand these fundamentals (main axis, cross axis, direction, layout & spacing)

## Further Learning / Room for Improvement
- Could add `flex-grow`, `flex-basis`, `flex-shrink`, and `order`
